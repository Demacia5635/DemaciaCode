/**
 * How the roboRIO is mounted on the robot, so its built-in accelerometer can be read in the
 * robot's frame (x forward, y left). Used by {@link RobotPose} for collision detection.
 *
 * <p>Each value is named by where the roboRIO's <b>label</b> faces (the accelerometer's +Z axis
 * comes out of the label: flat with the label up, Z reads +1 g) and where the accelerometer's
 * <b>X axis</b> points (drawn on the roboRIO). For example {@link #LABEL_LEFT_X_FRONT}: the
 * roboRIO stands on its side with the label facing the robot's left, and its X axis points to
 * the robot's front.
 *
 * <p>To check the choice on the robot (disabled, on the floor): {@code pose/acceleration x g} and
 * {@code y g} read about 0 at rest (if one reads about +-1 g, the X direction is wrong), lifting
 * the robot's front makes {@code x g} positive, and lifting its left side makes {@code y g}
 * positive.
