 * A single, self-contained, self-scored vision pose measurement. Each VisionSource computes

 * @param pose              The measured field-relative robot pose.
 * @param timestampSeconds  When this measurement was actually captured (e.g. FPGA time
 *                          minus the source's own reported latency)
 * @param stdDevs           This specific measurement's own confidence, per-axis
 *                          (x meters, y meters, theta radians)
