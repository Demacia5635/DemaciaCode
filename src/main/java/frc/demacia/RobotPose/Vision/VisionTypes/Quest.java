 * motion, and reports its pose relative to the last pose it was set to with
 * {@link #setPose}. So it has to be <b>anchored</b> to the fused estimate before its poses
 * mean anything on the field.
 *
 * <p>State:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code hasQuestDisconnected}: true at startup and after a disconnect, until the next
 * {@link #setPose}. While it is true and the Quest is connected, {@link #hasDrifted()} is
 * true and RobotPose re-anchors it.</li>
 * <li>{@code hasUpdatedQuestIntialPose}: set once a tracking frame arrives that was captured
 * at least {@link #QUEST_RESET_SETTLE_SECONDS} after the last {@link #setPose}. Only then
 * does {@link #shouldUpdate()} allow its measurements.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Only the newest unread frame each loop is used, and only if it is tracking. Its
 * position is converted from the headset to the robot center with the config offset; the
 * heading is copied from the estimate at the frame's time.
